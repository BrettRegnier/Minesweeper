## Introduction
This project was designed to help me learn how to make deep reinforcement learning neural networks using a clone of a game that is NP-Hard to solve.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python v3.7.x
* Tensorflow v2.1.0
* Keras v2.3.1
* CUDA Toolkit v10.1
* NVIDIA cuDNN v7.6.5
