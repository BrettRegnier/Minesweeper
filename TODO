Add different differentiating colors for the mines nearby
Game over
Reset
Menu

Need to raise an event that a tile has been clicked and then run the AI


Add a global definition of training tests so I don't need to manipulate many spots in code for training

Add an ingame cursor, so that I can see the cursor being used when in training/testing the RNN

Add screenshotting to be captured but not saved, as to be passed into the CNN model
Add a streamlined CNN model and use without having to reload it everytime.

REFACTOR AT THE END
