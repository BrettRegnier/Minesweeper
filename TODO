Add different differentiating colors for the mines nearby

    3 - Orange
    4 - Red
    5 - Darker Red?
    6 - Purple

Should add click handler and keyboard handler

Need to raise an event that a tile has been clicked and then run the AI


Add a global definition of training tests so I don't need to manipulate many spots in code for training
    -Including stopping the game from ending when a mine is hit

Add an ingame cursor, so that I can see the cursor being used when in training/testing the RNN

Add screenshotting to be captured but not saved, as to be passed into the CNN model
Add a streamlined CNN model and use without having to reload it everytime.

Make the folders automatically generate themselves

REFACTOR AT THE END
