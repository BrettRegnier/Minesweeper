Add a global definition of training tests so I don't need to manipulate many spots in code for training
    -Including stopping the game from ending when a mine is hit

Add screenshotting to be captured but not saved, as to be passed into the CNN model
Add a streamlined CNN model and use without having to reload it everytime.

Make the folders automatically generate themselves

Have the board deal with revealing other tiles based on idx

Note:
    Made this change to my core.py of keras-rl
    https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl/issues/161

Neural network to first decide which tiles MAY have a mine, via using convolutional NN on each tile... 
Train on a single tile and its neighbours?
